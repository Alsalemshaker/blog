## 📌 My First Impressions

The start of my studies in *Computer Science* has been very intense.  
From the very first month, we immersed ourselves in mathematics, the basics of algorithmization, and programming.  
It’s especially fascinating to see how abstract formulas from linear algebra find application in real computations.

## 💻 Programming Practice

The first assignments in **C++** taught me patience: sometimes compiler errors take more time to fix than writing the code itself.  
But it is precisely through such tasks that understanding of program structure and algorithm logic comes.  

In addition, we began learning **Python**. This language felt more “friendly” for beginners, while still being just as powerful.

## 🌍 Life at RUDN

One of the advantages of the university, in my opinion, is its international atmosphere.  
Communicating with students from different countries broadens my horizons and allows me to learn how IT is studied in other parts of the world.  
We are already discussing joint projects and sharing experiences.

## 🚀 Goals and Plans

- Build a strong foundation in algorithms and data structures.  
- Actively participate in student IT clubs and hackathons.  
- Prepare my first small projects to showcase on GitHub.  
- Start building a portfolio and sharing my progress.
