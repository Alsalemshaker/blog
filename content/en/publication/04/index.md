## 📌 What are Scientific Programming Languages?

Scientific programming languages are tools specifically designed to solve computationally intensive tasks: data analysis, physical process modeling, and working with large datasets.  
They allow researchers to focus on problem-solving rather than the details of low-level programming.

## 🔬 Popular Languages in Science

- **Fortran** — a classic of numerical computing. Still widely used in physics, chemistry, and engineering.  
- **MATLAB** — a powerful tool for data analysis, signal processing, and plotting.  
- **Python** — a versatile language that, thanks to libraries (*NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, TensorFlow*), has become a standard in scientific research.  
- **R** — a language for statistics and data analysis, especially popular in biology and sociology.  
- **Julia** — a modern language combining Python’s simplicity with C’s speed, rapidly gaining popularity among researchers.

## 🧑‍💻 Personal Experience

In my first university courses, I started working with **Python**. It proved very convenient for academic tasks and lab experiments.  
With NumPy and Matplotlib, it’s easy to solve a linear algebra problem and immediately visualize the results.  

I also tried MATLAB for numerical methods — I liked its simplicity in handling matrix operations.

## 🚀 Why is this Important for Students?

- Helps reinforce theoretical knowledge through practice.  
- Provides skills valued in both research and industry.  
- Expands opportunities: from writing simple scripts to working with artificial intelligence.

## 📖 Future Learning Plans

In the future, I want to try **Julia** and explore R more deeply for statistics.  
Combining several languages will allow me to approach research tasks flexibly and find the most efficient solutions.
