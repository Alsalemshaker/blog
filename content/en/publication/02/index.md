## 📌 What are Lightweight Markup Languages?

Lightweight markup languages are convenient tools for text formatting that allow you to focus on content rather than complex layout.  
They are used for writing documentation, notes, research papers, and even entire websites.  

Unlike HTML or LaTeX, these languages are simpler to use and much easier to read in raw form.

## ✍️ The Most Popular Languages

- **Markdown** — the most widely used. Common on GitHub, blogs, and CMS platforms. Simple and intuitive.  
- **reStructuredText (reST)** — widely adopted in the Python community for documentation.  
- **AsciiDoc** — powerful, well-suited for technical documentation and books.

## 🧑‍💻 Personal Experience

I most often work with **Markdown** since it’s perfect for notes, study summaries, and posts.  
It makes it easy to structure text: add headings, lists, links, or images.
