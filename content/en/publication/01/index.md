## 📌 What is Version Control?

Version control is a system that allows you to track changes in code or documents, roll back to previous states, and collaborate on projects as a team.  
Without such a system, development quickly turns into chaos: it becomes hard to understand who changed what and how to merge different people’s work.

## 🔧 Git as the De Facto Standard

Today, the most widely used tool in programming is **Git**. It is a distributed version control system that stores the complete history of changes for every developer.  

Main advantages include:  
- The ability to work offline.  
- Support for branching and merging.  
- Transparent change history.  
- Integration with GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and other platforms.

## 🧑‍💻 Personal Experience

In my early university courses, I started learning Git to manage lab work and small projects.  
At first, it wasn’t easy to remember the commands: `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`. But gradually, they became second nature.  
The most useful experience was working in a group: branches helped us divide tasks, and later we carefully merged the results together.

## 🚀 Why is it Important for Students?

- Projects are always accessible, and any version can be restored.  
- It’s easier to collaborate on term papers and research articles.  
- Git proficiency is highly valued by employers — it’s considered a fundamental skill for IT professionals.

## 📖 Future Plans

I want to dive deeper into:  
- advanced branching techniques;  
- automation with Git Hooks;  
- setting up CI/CD for student projects.  

Version control is not just a tool but a fundamental habit that makes work structured and professional.
