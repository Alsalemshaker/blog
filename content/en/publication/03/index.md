## 📌 Why is Proper Formatting Important?

A report is not just a text with results but a document that should be clear, logical, and neatly organized.  
Proper formatting helps the professor or research supervisor quickly understand the work done and evaluate its quality.

## 📝 Key Elements of a Report

1. **Title Page** — name of the work, student’s full name, group, faculty, date.  
2. **Objective and Tasks** — a short description of the purpose of the work.  
3. **Process** — step-by-step explanation of actions, calculations, or code.  
4. **Results** — obtained data, tables, and graphs.  
5. **Conclusion** — a brief analysis of what was achieved.  
6. **References** — sources used.

## 🧑‍💻 Personal Experience

For report formatting, I usually use **Markdown** or **LaTeX**.  
Markdown is convenient for quick lab work: the text is easy to structure and convert into PDF.  
LaTeX, on the other hand, is better suited for more serious documents with formulas and tables — it’s ideal for math and programming tasks.

## 🎯 Tips for Students

- Use a consistent style throughout the document (font, headings, spacing).  
- Add illustrations and diagrams if they help explain the material.  
- Check spelling and grammar before submission.  
- Keep the writing concise and to the point, avoiding unnecessary information.

## 🚀 Future Plans

I want to set up a LaTeX template for automatically formatting lab and coursework reports.  
This will allow me to focus on the content instead of formatting details.
