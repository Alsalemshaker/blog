## 🌐 Why Have a Personal Website?

For a modern student and future researcher, a personal website is a business card in the academic and scientific world.  
It helps share research results, publish articles, and showcase academic and project achievements. Such a site builds a professional image and makes networking with colleagues easier.

## 📚 Personal Experience

I started building my personal academic website using **Hugo Academic**.  
I added an *“About Me”* section to introduce my field of study and research interests. I also configured blocks for *publications* and *projects*, along with a feed for short notes and posts about student life.  

The process turned out to be straightforward: basic knowledge of Git and Markdown was enough to get started. The main challenge was customizing the theme to fit my needs and understanding the configuration system.

## 🚀 What’s Next?

My plans include:  
- Regularly updating the website and maintaining a blog about student projects.  
- Adding materials on computer science and code examples.  
- Creating a section with presentations and conference talks.  

Building a personal website has been a great way to combine IT practice with developing my academic profile.  
And the best part — the site is fully under my control and reflects my vision of a professional path.
