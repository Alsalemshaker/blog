## ðŸ“Œ Week from August 8 to August 14

Although classes havenâ€™t started yet, the atmosphere already feels academic. I bought the necessary notebooks, pens, and upgraded my laptop to be ready for programming and online lectures.  

This week passed in a calm rhythm: I studied English to better understand technical texts.  
In addition, I took part in a student football tournament organized by the community. It was a great way to meet future classmates.
