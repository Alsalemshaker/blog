## ðŸ“Œ Week from August 15 to August 21

This week was marked by organizational meetings. We received our class schedule, got acquainted with the deanâ€™s office, and learned about upcoming faculty events.  

The highlight was a tour of the RUDN campus. We were shown laboratories, computer classrooms, and the library. It felt clear that many opportunities for growth lie ahead.
