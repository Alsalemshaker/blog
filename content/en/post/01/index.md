## ðŸ“Œ Week from August 1 to August 7

The first week of August went by in the spirit of summer holidays. Most students are still enjoying their break, but the anticipation of the upcoming academic year is already in the air.  
I used this time to finish reading a book on algorithms and practiced a bit of C++.  

I also spent time walking around Moscow, exploring the city and its cultural landmarks. In the evenings, I watched lectures on YouTube about computer science â€” I want to enter September feeling more prepared.
