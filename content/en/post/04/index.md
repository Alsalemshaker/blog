## ðŸ“Œ Week from August 22 to August 28

This week turned out to be a transitional one. The first orientation lectures took place, along with introductory classes in mathematics and programming.  
Getting to know my group went smoothly â€” we discussed upcoming assignments and shared expectations.  

Beyond studies, I joined a student IT community where peers work on projects and take part in hackathons. This is both inspiring and motivating, pushing me to improve my skills faster.
